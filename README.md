# Hey, I'm Cesar

I'm a **software engineer and indie builder** focused on building real, working products — not just demos.

I specialize in **backend systems, product engineering, and turning ideas into shipped software**.  
I enjoy owning projects end-to-end: from architecture and APIs to UX, deployment, and iteration.

I currently work mainly with **Java, JavaScript, and modern web stacks**, and I spend a lot of time building side projects, SaaS tools, and developer infrastructure.

## 🚀 What I build

I like working on products that actually get used. Some of the things I've built:

### **Rediate**
**AI workspace for content creators**
> Turns Reddit signals into structured content ideas using sentiment, trend detection and refinement flows.

- Live product: https://getrediate.com  
- GitHub: https://github.com/crlian/rediate  
- Focus: LLM pipelines, data ingestion, UI for creative workflows

---

### **Sherlog**
**Browser-based log analysis tool**
> Parses, clusters and visualizes large logs locally using WASM — nothing leaves your machine.

- GitHub: https://github.com/crlian/sherlog  
- Focus: performance, privacy-first tooling, developer experience

---

### **FairSplit**
**Collaborative expense-splitting app**
> Real-time, multi-user sessions for tracking and settling group expenses.

- Live: https://fair-split-seven.vercel.app  
- GitHub: https://github.com/Cesar-Rico/fair-split  
- Focus: real-time UX, state sync, collaborative flows

## 🧠 How I think about engineering

I care a lot about:

- **Clean architecture & maintainability**
- **Systems that don’t fall over in production**
- **Developer experience**
- **Fast iteration loops**

I enjoy debugging messy systems, improving reliability, and making things simpler than they were before.

I’ve worked on large backend systems handling:
- Financial calculations  
- Business rules  
- High-volume data  
- Integrations across multiple services  

Using **Java, Spring Boot, Oracle, SQL Server, Redis, Docker and CI/CD pipelines**.

## 🛠 Tech I use

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, Python
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Infra:** Docker, CI/CD, Linux
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Redis
- **AI / LLMs:** OpenAI, Claude, custom pipelines, agent workflows
- **Tooling:** Git, GitHub Actions, Vercel, cloud deployments

---

## 🧪 Open-source & experiments

I like exploring:
- AI agents & orchestration
- Developer tooling
- Automation
- Product UX for complex systems

Most of what I build ends up open-source or publicly deployed.
