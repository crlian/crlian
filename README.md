I’m a software engineer and indie builder focused on **shipping real products — not just demos**.

I work mostly on **backend systems**, **full-stack applications**, and **developer tooling**.  
I enjoy taking ideas from **zero to production**: architecture, APIs, UI, infra, and iteration.

I currently work mainly with **Java, JavaScript, React, and modern web stacks**, building **SaaS tools**, **internal platforms**, and **AI-powered products**.

### What I care about

- Clean, maintainable architectures  
- Systems that don’t fall over in production  
- Fast iteration loops  
- Developer experience and tooling  

Most of what I build is **open-source or publicly deployed**.  
You’ll find my products, experiments, and active work below in the **pinned repositories** 👇
