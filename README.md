Hey, I’m Cesar

I’m a software engineer and indie builder focused on shipping real products — not just demos.

I work mostly on backend systems, full-stack applications, and developer tooling.  
I enjoy taking ideas from zero to production: architecture, APIs, UI, infra, and iteration.

I currently work mainly with Java, JavaScript, React, and modern web stacks, building SaaS tools, internal platforms, and AI-powered products.

What I care about  
• Clean, maintainable architectures  
• Systems that don’t fall over in production  
• Fast iteration loops  
• Developer experience and tooling  

Most of what I build is open-source or publicly deployed.  
You’ll find my products, experiments, and active work below in the pinned repos.
