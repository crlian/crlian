# Hey, I'm Cesar

I'm a **software engineer and indie builder** focused on building and shipping real products.

I specialize in **backend systems, product engineering, and turning ideas into working software**.

## 🧠 How I work

I care about:
- Clean architecture
- Systems that don’t fall over in production
- Developer experience
- Fast iteration loops

I enjoy debugging messy systems, improving reliability, and making things simpler than they were before.

I've worked on large backend systems handling:
- Financial calculations
- Business rules
- High-volume data
- Integrations across multiple services  

Using **Java, Spring Boot, Oracle, SQL Server, Redis, Docker and CI/CD pipelines**.
